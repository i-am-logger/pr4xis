# Citings — Concurrency -- Agents, shared resources, synchronization, hazards

Every published source this ontology stands on. Entries below are drawn from the ontology's [README.md](README.md) and the doc comments on its axioms. Where a full bibliographic entry exists in the workspace-wide [`docs/papers/references.md`](../../../../../../docs/papers/references.md), the short form here is a pointer.

## Primary sources

- Hoare 1978: *Communicating Sequential Processes* (CSP)
- Milner 1980: *A Calculus of Communicating Systems* (CCS)
- Hewitt 1973: Actor Model
- Lamport 1978: *Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System*

- **Local PDF:** [`papers/hoare-csp-1978.pdf`](papers/hoare-csp-1978.pdf) — Hoare 1978

## Cross-references

- Workspace bibliography: [`docs/papers/references.md`](../../../../../../docs/papers/references.md)
- Source attributions per axiom: see the `Source` column in the `## Axioms` table in [`README.md`](README.md)
- Code-level citations: `grep -n 'Source:\|Reference:' *.rs` in this directory

## Pending verification

Every entry under **Primary sources** is a short pointer. For each one, confirm that a full citation (Author, Year, Title, DOI/URL) exists in `docs/papers/references.md`. Where no entry exists, add it (or a local PDF under a `papers/` subdirectory) before declaring the ontology citation-complete.

Open items for human review:

- [ ] Cross-check every primary source against `docs/papers/references.md`
- [ ] Add code-comment-level citations (`// Source: ...`) to axioms that currently lack attribution
- [ ] If this ontology depends on a paper not yet in the workspace bibliography, move/copy the PDF into a local `papers/` subdirectory and link it from the primary source line above

- **How this file is maintained:** auto-initialized by the per-ontology rollout (issue #57) from `README.md`'s *Key references* section. Update by hand as code-comment citations, local PDFs, and `docs/papers/references.md` entries are added.
